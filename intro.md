# stack.gl package documentation

This is a full list of the packages that fall under the
[stack.gl](http://stack.gl) umbrella, catalogued into a single page with all
of their documentation for you to peruse at your leisure.

You can very easily add your own packages to this list by updating
[the GitHub wiki](http://github.com/stackgl/packages/wiki/Packages/_edit).
You'll see your repository added to the list when it's next updated, which
happens once every hour or so. No need to be shy contributing: the more
the merrier!
