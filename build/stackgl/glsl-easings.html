<p><a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/">Robert Penner&apos;s easing functions</a> in GLSL,
available as a module for <a href="http://github.com/chrisdickinson/glslify">glslify</a>.</p>
<p>I tried as best I could to make them speedy for GLSL, but I&apos;m sure there are a
lot of gaps to fill &#x2013; pull requests welcome!</p>

<p><a href="https://nodei.co/npm/glsl-easings/"></a></p>
<p>Each easing function has its own file which can be required from glslify:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-glsl"><span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/back-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/back-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/back-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/bounce-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/bounce-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/bounce-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/circular-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/circular-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/circular-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/cubic-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/cubic-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/cubic-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/elastic-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/elastic-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/elastic-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/exponential-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/exponential-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/exponential-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/linear)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/quadratic-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/quadratic-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/quadratic-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/quartic-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/quartic-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/quartic-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/quintic-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/quintic-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/quintic-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/sine-in-out)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/sine-in)</span>
<span class="cp">#pragma glslify: ease = require(glsl-easings/sine-out)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And each function has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-glsl"><span class="k">float</span> <span class="n">ease</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">float</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>t</code> is a value between 0 and 1, returning a new float between 0 and 1.</p>
